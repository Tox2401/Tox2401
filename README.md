### About me

Self-taught back-end developer with a desire to move into the IT industry. I'm a quick-learner, extremely motivated to expand
and work on my knowledge.
For the past year, I've been devoting my free time to learning through Udemy courses and other literature, I've completed the
"Java Programming" course held by the Computer Science Department of the University of Helsinki.

My self-taught journey resulted in a several smaller beginner level projects available on my GitHub and gave me the
opportunity to work with several languages:
- Python + Flask
- Java
- Kotlin + Android studio
- SQL - SQLite

Working in a maritime industry in the capacity of an officer helped me develop several key qualities:
- Leadership skills
- Working in a multi-cultural environment
- Problem solving and negotiation
- Showing initiative and being a reliable part of the team
- Continuous development and adaptation to new technologies
