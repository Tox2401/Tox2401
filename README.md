### About me

A self-taught back-end developer eager to transition into the IT industry, I bring a proactive learning attitude and strong
motivation to continuously expand my knowledge. I am confident that my skills and dedication make me a compelling
candidate.
Over the past year, I have dedicated my free time to learning through Udemy courses and extensive literature. Notably, I
completed the "Java Programming" course offered by the Computer Science Department of the University of Helsinki.

Through my self-taught journey, I have developed several beginner-level projects showcased on my GitHub profile. These
projects have allowed me to gain practical experience with various programming languages, including:
- C# & .NET
- SQL
- Python

Working in a maritime industry in the capacity of an officer helped me develop several key qualities:
- Leadership skills
- Proficiency in problem-solving and negotiation
- Demonstrated initiative and reliability within a team dynamic
- Adaptability to working in diverse, multicultural environments
- A commitment to continuous development and the integration of new technologies
